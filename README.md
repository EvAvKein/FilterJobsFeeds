# Filter Jobs Feeds

A Chrome extension for blacklisting text to filter your jobs feeds, currently compatible with LinkedIn and AngelList

<details>
  <summary>Why'd you create this?</summary>
  I originally created it strictly for personal use, out of frustration with a particular company's overwhelming improperly-tagged sponsored spam to the LinkedIn jobs feed (which occupied +70% of every page of my feed with shocking consistency)... and after my attempts to resolve the issue (for more than just myself) fell on deaf/inattentive ears both at that company's proprietary support and LinkedIn's support.
