# Filter LinkedIn Jobs

An extension I created for personal use, due to frustration with a particular company's sheer volume of improperly-tagged automated posts to the LinkedIn jobs feed (occupying more than 70% of every page of my feed with shocking consistency).  

This extension became my last resort after my attempts to resolve this spam issue (for more than just myself) fell on deaf/inattentive ears, both at that company's proprietary support and at LinkedIn's support. There's unfortunately no built-in way (as of writing this) to block/hide particular accounts on LinkedIn and/or the jobs feed.
